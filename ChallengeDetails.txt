**1. Song Catalog**

Imagine that you need to create a music-player app.

Create a class that can represent the structure of a song. The Song class must include these code elements:

- Variables for the title, artist, year published, and play count
- A variable/function that indicates whether the song is popular. If the play count is less than 1,000, consider it unpopular.
- A function that prints a song description in this format:

"[Title], performed by [artist], was released in [year published]."

**2. Temperature Converter**

In this case, there are three main temperature scales used in the world: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin (You can also add Reamur if you want).

Write a program that converts a temperature from one scale to another for these conditions (you can use dart input or not):

- Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Kelvin to Celsius
- Fahrenheit to Kelvin
